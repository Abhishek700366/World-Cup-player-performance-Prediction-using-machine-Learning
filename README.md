# World-Cup-player-performance-Prediction-using-machine-Learning



Introduction:
Cricket, a sport rich in data, provides an ideal domain for leveraging machine learning to predict 
player performance. This study outlines a methodology encompassing dataset exploration, model 
development, and the presentation of experimental results to forecast cricket players’ performance.


Methodology:
1.Dataset Selection:
• Choose a comprehensive dataset containing historical records of cricket players, 
encompassing batting, bowling, and fielding statistics.
• Ensure the dataset includes variables such as runs scored, wickets taken, strike rates, and 
other relevant metrics.

2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
• Conduct a thorough EDA to understand the characteristics and distributions of the data.
• Explore correlations between different features and identify key factors influencing player 
performance.

3.Model Building:
• Employ supervised machine learning algorithms like regression or ensemble methods for 
prediction tasks.
• Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance accurately.
• Fine-tune hyper-parameters to optimise model accuracy and generalisation.

Conclusion:
The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of employing machine learning 
for predicting cricket players’ performance. The insights gained through this methodology can 
significantly benefit team management, selectors, and fantasy cricket enthusiasts.


Future Scope:
Develop models capable of adapting to evolving player form and changing game dynamics.
Explore the potential for implementing real-time prediction systems during live matches.
Tailor models for individual player prediction, considering unique playing styles and strengths.
Expected outcome:
This methodology lays the foundation for a sophisticated system to predict cricket player 
performance, with ample opportunities for refinement and expansion in the future.
